## Basic Rules
* If you enter the recharge invoice, and supply the debit chart strings, and enter your own email as the customer, then you can't do the payment approval step.
* Other than the above, anyone with a CAS login and the link to the payment page may do the payment approval step. This can involve entering or editing chart strings and approving.
* The payment approval step does not have a reject option.
