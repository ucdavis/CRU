This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

It deploys a static site to the out/ directory which we'll host on Cloudflare Pages.

## Getting Started

Make sure you do an npm install before you run for the first time:

```bash
npm install
```

Then just start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploying

Running `npm run build` produces a static export in the `out/` directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

Upload the contents of `out/` to your hosting provider (e.g. Cloudflare Pages) to deploy the site.
