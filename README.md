This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

It is deployed on [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) using the [OpenNext.js](https://opennextjs.com) framework.

## Getting Started

Make sure you do an npm install before you run for the first time:

```bash
npm install
```

Then just start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploying to Cloudflare Workers

Anything checked into the `main` branch will be automatically deployed to Cloudflare Workers.

You can run locally as described above, but to preview what you site would look like on Cloudflare Workers before you commit, you can use:

```bash
npm run preview
```
